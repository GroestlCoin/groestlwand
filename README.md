    git clone https://github.com/Groestlcoin/groestlwand.git
    cd groestlwand
    npm install
    npm install -g gulp

    gulp build
    gulp watch
    migrations/migrate 001
    node server.js

It's easiest to work with the bookmarklet as a chrome extension. It will make your life easier if you use something like [extension reloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid?hl=en).

`ansible-playbook ansible/site.yml -i ansible/hosts --private-key ~/.ssh/Tok  -vvv`
